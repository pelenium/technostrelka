# @scaleflex/icons

SVG icons as React components.

---

## Installation

```shell script
npm i @scaleflex/icons # react react-dom
```

```shell script
yarn add @scaleflex/icons # react react-dom
```

> Make sure to have `react` and `react-dom` installed in your package as they are included in our peer dependencies.

## Usage

Every icon present in this package is a pure React component, wrapping plain `svg` element.
Each component is exported by default and gives access to the `ref` and `className` props, as well as standard `svg` attributes.

```typescript jsx
import DownloadIcon from '@scaleflex/icons/download';
```
